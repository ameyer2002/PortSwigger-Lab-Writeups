# Username Enumeration via Response Timing

**Scenario:**
This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration using its response times. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

# Username Enumeration:

The first step here will be to access the login page and input a random username and password to generate a HTTP request which we can then intercept using Proxy > Intercept. Find the POST request that was generated by your login attempt as this will allow us to modify it before ultimately reaching the server. We can then send this request to Repeater.
