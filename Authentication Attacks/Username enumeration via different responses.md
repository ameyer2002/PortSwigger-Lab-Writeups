# Username Enumeration via Different responses

**Scenario:** This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

The first step here will be to access the login page and input a random username and password to generate a HTTP request which we can then intercept using Proxy > Intercept. Find the POST request that was generated by your login attempt as this will allow us to modify it before ultimately reaching the server.
